### 📘 Materials Studied

- 02 - Submission on Design Patterns  

### ✅ Assignments Submitted

- 02 - Submission on Design Patterns 

### 🔹 Topics Covered

#### 🔸 Design Principles
- SOLD princliples
```
S – Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
➡ One class = one responsibility
✔ Easy to maintain, easy to test

O – Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
➡ Open for extension, closed for modification
✔ Add new features without breaking old code

L – Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
➡ Child class should replace parent class without breaking logic

I – Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
➡ Many small interfaces > one fat interface
✔ No class should implement unused methods

D – Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
➡ Depend on abstractions, not concrete classes
✔ Loose coupling
```

#### 🔸 Design Patterns
- Creational Design Patterns
- Structural Design Patterns
- Behavioral Design Patterns

```
Design principles tell you how to design clean code,
Design patterns give you proven solutions to recurring design problems.
